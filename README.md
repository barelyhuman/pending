Simple Kanban Project Tracker

## Motivation
Just a side project that started as a offline browser kanban and is moving towards a proper app for people and teams to use while focusing on making it easier for me to track all my ideas and projects.

### Goal
A simplistic and easy to use project tasks tracker with certain features I wish I can translate from my paper tracking approach.

## Develop 
 - Fork this repository 
 - Create a branch in the format `fix|feat|chore-<issue-id>` replace `<issue-id>` with the issue you are fixing and use `fix|feat|chore` appropriately. Eg: a fix from issue 122 will be `fix-122`, a feature request on issue id 10 will be `feat-10`. Optionally, if you'd like to, add a short name after it. `fix-122-replace-schema`.
 - Make needed fixes/changes
 - Make a pull request.

## Contribute
You are free to pick up any issues as the pop up and raise a pull request. Code style is already handled by Standard JS and other standards can be referred to, with the existing code.
